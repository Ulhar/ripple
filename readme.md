# Ripple

Ripple is an audio library for LÃ–VE that simplifies various aspects of audio handling, including tagging and playing multiple instances of a sound.

## Installation

To use Ripple, place ripple.lua in your project, and then add this code to your main.lua:

```lua
ripple = require 'ripple' -- if your ripple.lua is in the root directory
ripple = require 'path.to.ripple' -- if it's in subfolders
```

## API

### ripple
This is the main module that lets you create sounds and tags.

#### Functions

##### `local sound = ripple.newSound(source, options)`
Creates a new sound.

Parameters:
- `source` (`Source`) - the source to use for the sound
- `options` (`table`) (optional) - options to apply to the sound. The options table can have the following values:
  - `volume` (`number`) (optional, defaults to `1`) - the volume of the sound, from 0 to 1
  - `tags` (`table`) (optional) - a list of tags to apply to the sound
  - `effects` (`table`) (optional) - the effects to apply to the sound. Each key should be the name of the effect, and each value should be one of the following:
    - `true` - enables the effect without a filter
    - `table` - enables the effect with the filter settings specified in the table
    - `false` - explicitly disables the effect, even if the effect would normally be inherited from a tag
  - `loop` (`boolean`) (optional) - whether the sound should be repeated until stopped

Returns:
- `sound` (`Sound`) - the newly created sound

##### `local tag = ripple.newTag(options)`
Creates a new tag.

Parameters:
- `options` (`table`) (optional) - options to apply to the tag. The options table can have the following values:
  - `volume` (`number`) (optional, defaults to `1`) - the volume of the tag, from 0 to 1
  - `tags` (`table`) (optional) - a list of tags to apply to the tag
  - `effects` (`table`) (optional) - the effects to apply to the tag. Each key should be the name of the effect, and each value should be one of the following:
    - `true` - enables the effect without a filter
    - `table` - enables the effect with the filter settings specified in the table
    - `false` - explicitly disables the effect, even if the effect would normally be inherited from a tag

Returns:
- `tag` (`Tag`) - the newly created tag

### Taggable
This class is not something you create directly, but it does contain functions you can use on any taggable object: sounds, instances, and tags.

#### Properties

##### `Taggable.volume (number)`
The volume of the taggable object from 0 to 1.

#### Functions

##### `Taggable:tag(...)`
Applies one or more tags to a taggable object.

Parameters:
- `...` (`Tag`) - the tags to apply

##### `Taggable:untag(...)`
Removes one or more tags from a taggable object.

Parameters:
- `...` (`Tag`) - the tags to remove

##### `Taggable:setEffect(name, filterSettings)`
Enables or disables an effect on a taggable object.

Parameters:
- `name` (`string`) - the effect to enable or disable
- `filterSettings` (`boolean` or `table`) (optional)
  - `false` - explicitly disables the effect, even if the taggable object would normally inherit the effect
  - `true` - enables the effect without any filter
  - `table` - enables the effect with the given filter settings

##### `Taggable:removeEffect(name)`
Unsets an effects on a taggable object.

Parameters:
- `name` (`string`) - the name of the effect to remove

##### `local effect = Taggable:getEffect(name)`
Gets the effect definition of a taggable object.

Returns one of the following:
- `false` - the effect is explicitly disabled
- `true` - the effect is enabled with no filter
- `table` - the effect is enabled with the given filter settings
- `nil` - the effect is not set on this object

### Sound
Sounds represent a piece of audio that you can play back multiple times simultaneously with different pitches and volumes. Inherits from Taggable.

#### Properties

##### `Sound.loop (boolean)`
Whether the sound should be repeated until stopped.

#### Functions

##### `local instance = Sound:play(options)`
Plays a sound.

Parameters:
- `options` (`table`) (optional) - options to apply to this instance of the sound. The options table can have the following values:
  - `volume` (`number`) (optional, defaults to `1`) - the volume of the instance, from 0 to 1
  - `tags` (`table`) (optional) - a list of tags to apply to the instance
  - `effects` (`table`) (optional) - the effects to apply to the instance. Each key should be the name of the effect, and each value should be one of the following:
    - `true` - enables the effect without a filter
    - `table` - enables the effect with the filter settings specified in the table
    - `false` - explicitly disables the effect, even if the effect would normally be inherited from the parent sound or a tag
  - `loop` (`boolean`) (optional) - whether the instance of the sound should be repeated until stopped
  - `pitch` (`number`) (optional, defaults to `1`) - the pitch to play the sound at - 2 would be twice as fast and one octave up, .5 would be half speed and one octave down
  - `seek` (`number`) (optional) - the position to start the sound at in seconds
  - `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade in the sound from silence

Returns:
- `instance` (`Instance`) - the new instance of the sound

##### `Sound:pause(fadeDuration)`
Pauses all instances of this sound.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before pausing it

##### `Sound:resume(fadeDuration)`
Resumes all of the paused instances of this sound.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound from silence

##### `Sound:stop(fadeDuration)`
Stops all instances of this sound.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before stopping it

### Instance
An instance is a single occurrence of a sound. Inherits from Taggable.

#### Properties

##### `Instance.loop (boolean)`
Whether this instance of a sound should be repeated until stopped.

##### `Instance.pitch (number)`
The pitch of the instance.

#### Functions

##### `local stopped = Instance:isStopped()`
Returns if the instance is stopped, either because it reached the end of the sound or it was manually stopped. Note that stopped instances may be reused later.

##### `Instance:pause(fadeDuration)`
Pauses the instance.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before pausing it

##### `Instance:resume(fadeDuration)`
Resumes a paused instance.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound from silence

##### `Instance:stop(fadeDuration)`
Stops the instance.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before stopping it

### Tag
A tag represents a category of sounds. You can apply it to sounds to control the volume and effect settings of multiple sounds at once.

#### Functions

##### `Tag:pause(fadeDuration)`
Pauses all of the sounds tagged with this tag.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before pausing it

##### `Tag:resume(fadeDuration)`
Resumes all of the paused sounds tagged with this tag.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound from silence

##### `Tag:stop(fadeDuration)`
Stops all of the sounds tagged with this tag.

Parameters:
- `fadeDuration` (`number`) (optional) - the length of time to use to fade the sound to silence before stopping it
